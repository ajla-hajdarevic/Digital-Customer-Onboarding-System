Digitalization of Customer Onboarding Process using Cognitive Services

Digital customer onboarding, the Fintech web solution, creates a new and personalized customer onboarding experience by streamlining and optimizing the entire process, lowering its complexity and time-consumption. 

The means of identifying customers are utilized through Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services that provide machine learning functionalities of solving problems. Digital Onboarding process enforces the following capacities: a customized and personalized front end, a collection of clientâ€™s data and identification documents, and a progressive photo face recognition for identification and verification of clients.

Digital customer onboarding uses OCR to extract and display customer personal data from the ID card uploaded by the user. Face Service implements algorithms that identify and examine human faces. The customer captures a selfie by device camera to verify the identity. Face Recognition Services enable the onboarding system to identify the customer, according to the face, and verify customer identity. Customer identity verification is performed by examining whether two human faces, detected on the ID card and the captured selfie, belong to the same person. When identity is verified, a user is successfully onboarded and registered as a customer.

The Digital Customer Onboarding Web Application is developed in Angular framework, as a frontend solution, and ASP .NET framework as a backend solution and a direct connection and communication with the MySQL data storage source.
